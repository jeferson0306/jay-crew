## X-Ray Mode

Analyze the source code, architecture, and the user's request. Produce a deep technical report covering:

1. **Current Code Quality** — Code smells, anti-patterns, technical debt, refactoring opportunities
2. **Logical Analysis of the Task** — What needs to be implemented, required algorithms, complexity
3. **Edge Cases & Error Scenarios** — What can go wrong, boundary cases that must be handled
4. **Recommended Design Patterns** — Which design patterns to apply for the request
5. **Technical Attention Points** — Bottlenecks, typing issues, memory leaks, race conditions
