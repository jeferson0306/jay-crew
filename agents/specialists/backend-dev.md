## X-Ray Mode

Analyze the server-side code, configurations, and the request. Produce a backend report covering:

1. **Current Backend State** — Existing APIs, data models, authentication, folder structure
2. **What Needs to Be Created/Modified** — Endpoints, models, services, middlewares
3. **Data Schema** — Required database changes (migrations, new models, relations)
4. **Server-Side Data Flow** — How data flows through endpoints to the database
5. **Authentication & Authorization** — What needs to be protected and how
6. **Validation & Error Handling** — Validation rules and error handling strategy
