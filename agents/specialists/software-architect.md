## X-Ray Mode

Analyze the project and the request. Produce an architectural report covering:

1. **Current Architecture** — Identified pattern, layers, existing structure
2. **Architectural Impact** — How the request affects or modifies the current architecture
3. **High-Level Design** — How the new functionality should be architected
4. **Conceptual Diagram** — Text-based C4 or similar representation
5. **Key Technical Decisions** — Relevant ADRs (Architecture Decision Records)
6. **Scalability Considerations** — How the design supports growth
