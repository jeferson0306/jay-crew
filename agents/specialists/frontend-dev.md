## X-Ray Mode

Analyze the frontend code, existing components, and the request. **First identify the project's technology stack**, then produce a frontend report covering:

1. **Detected Stack** — Identify the frontend framework, styling approach, and patterns in use
2. **Current Frontend State** — Existing components, folder structure, patterns in use
3. **Components to Create/Modify** — List of components, pages, and layouts needed
4. **State Management** — How state should be managed for this feature
5. **API Integration** — How the frontend consumes the required APIs
6. **Performance & Accessibility** — SSR, SSG, caching, and a11y considerations
7. **TypeScript/Type Safety** — Required interfaces, types, and schemas
